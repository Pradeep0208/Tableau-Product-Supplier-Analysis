#  Product & Supplier Financial Insights â€“ Tableau Dashboard

##  Project Overview
This Tableau dashboard provides a detailed business analysis of product performance and supplier contributions using financial metrics such as **Gross Revenue**, **Net Revenue**, **Cost**, and **Sales Quantity**. The visualizations are interactive and driven by user-selected parameters like product ranking, financial measures, and threshold filters.

##  Objectives
- Identify top-performing and underperforming products.
- Compare average quantity sold vs. average gross revenue across products.
- Track supplier-level performance based on customizable revenue thresholds.
- Enable dynamic filtering and visual storytelling for business stakeholders.

## ðŸ§  Insights Uncovered
- Many products with **high quantity sold** are not necessarily **top revenue generators**.
- Several suppliers consistently produce **above-threshold products**, useful for inventory strategy.
- A few products perform **poorly in both revenue and volume**, ideal candidates for promotion or discontinuation.
- The **geographical trends** reveal regional strengths for targeted marketing.
